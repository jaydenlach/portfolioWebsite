Thanks for stopping by and visiting on my journey to becoming a data scientist and beyond. My goal for this site is to document my studies and to bring interesting data to life with stories, visualisations, reproducible code (hopefully :no_mouth:) and maybe a cat picture or two.

Please keep in mind, just like the projects and learning are a work in progress, so too is this site.
